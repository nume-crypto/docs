Select the token you want to bridge in the token drop-down menu.

Enter the amount of tokens you want to bridge over in the field and then press bridge funds. Follow the prompts on MetaMask.
Please make sure you leave enough MATIC on your wallet to pay for the transaction, otherwise there will be no MetaMask popup.

After you submit the transaction through MetaMask you can expect your funds to arrive on Nume One within roughly 1 minute to an hour (depending on the chain congestion).
Also make sure your MetaMask wallet is set to nume network so you can see your funds when they arrive.
