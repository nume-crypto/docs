Fees are additional amounts that a user pays to the network for the use of the network. Fees are paid in the native token of the network which is DAI. List of fees are as follows:

?> **During asset transfers using MetaMask, you may notice a slight discrepancy in the estimated gas cost. However, the network will only charge 0.05 DAI.**
