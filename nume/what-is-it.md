# What is it?

Nume is a gas-free, scalable and secure web3 payments protocol with primitives tailored for commerce.

It is a platform that provides:
- Layer 2 solutions on the most secure and decentralized layer 1 - Ethereum
- APIs and developer tools that make it easy to build on layer 2

## Designed on First Principles

- **Trustless Security** Nume does not make any trust assumptions on top of Ethereum. If you trust Ethereum, you can trust Nume. 
- **Data Availability** Every user is revealed sufficient information about each settlement to be able to withdraw their funds trustlessly and directly from the contract at any time.
- **Non-custodial** The Nume Protocol is non-custodial and guarantees that a settlement with unauthorized changes to users’ balances will not succeed on-chain.
- **Decentralized Governance** The protocol is governed by validators. Any changes to the Nume off chain state verification algorithm requires validators’ signature.

## Why Ethereum?
Immutable chose to build on Ethereum because it is the most decentralized, secure and widely-used blockchain, giving rise to the greatest network effects.
It is a technology that enables smart contracts and decentralized applications to be built and run without any downtime, fraud, control or interference from a third party.
